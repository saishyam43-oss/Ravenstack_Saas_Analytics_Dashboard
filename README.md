## 🏢 Client Background & Analytics Context

**Ravenstack** is a fictional B2B SaaS company operating on a subscription-based revenue model with multiple plan tiers (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise). The company has successfully scaled customer acquisition and revenue but is experiencing **increasing uncertainty around growth quality and customer retention**.

As the business enters a scaling phase, leadership requires deeper visibility into:
- Whether revenue growth is sustainable
- Where and why customers churn
- Whether product usage translates into long-term value
- Which customer segments truly justify continued investment

### Key Stakeholders
- **Product Leadership** – responsible for onboarding experience and feature adoption  
- **Growth & Marketing** – focused on acquisition efficiency and funnel performance  
- **Customer Success** – accountable for churn reduction and expansion  
- **Revenue & Finance** – concerned with MRR stability, LTV, and concentration risk  

This analysis was commissioned to support **cross-functional decision-making**, not just reporting.

## 🎯 Business Problem & Objective

### Business Problem
Despite strong headline revenue growth, Ravenstack faces several unresolved risks:
- High customer churn offsets acquisition gains
- Retention appears to be weakening for newer cohorts
- Product usage does not clearly correlate with customer longevity
- A small segment of customers contributes a disproportionate share of revenue

These signals raise a critical question:  
**Is Ravenstack scaling efficiently, or accumulating hidden risk beneath top-line growth?**

### Objective
The objective of this analysis is to:
- Evaluate the **quality of growth**, not just its magnitude
- Identify **where in the customer lifecycle value breaks down**
- Assess whether **product adoption drives retention**
- Quantify **customer segment value and operational efficiency**
- Surface **clear, actionable strategic recommendations**

## ⭐ North Star Metrics & Analytical Focus

The analysis is anchored around a focused set of **North Star metrics** that collectively describe growth health, retention strength, and customer value:

- **Total Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**  
  Measures business scale and revenue concentration risk.

- **Quick Ratio**  
  Evaluates growth efficiency by comparing revenue gains to churn and contraction.

- **Churn Rate (Lifetime & Early-Stage)**  
  Identifies whether acquisition efforts translate into durable customers.

- **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**  
  Assesses expansion, contraction, and long-term revenue stability.

- **Time-to-Value**  
  Measures how quickly users realize meaningful product value.

- **ARPU & LTV (Proxy)**  
  Used to compare customer segment value and prioritize investment.

These metrics guide every dashboard and insight in the project.

## 🧭 Analytical Approach

The analysis follows a **top-down diagnostic framework**, moving from growth outcomes to root causes:

1. **Growth Efficiency Analysis**  
   Evaluates whether revenue gains outpace churn and contraction.

2. **Retention & Cohort Analysis**  
   Identifies when customers churn and how retention patterns evolve over time.

3. **Product Usage & Time-to-Value Analysis**  
   Assesses whether users meaningfully engage with the product before churning.

4. **Segment-Level Value & Efficiency Analysis**  
   Compares customer segments by lifetime value relative to operational cost.

This structured approach ensures insights are **causal, not descriptive**.

## 📊 Executive Summary (North Star View)

At a surface level, Ravenstack appears healthy, with strong MRR growth and a Quick Ratio consistently above 3.0, indicating efficient acquisition.

However, deeper analysis reveals a critical imbalance. **Lifetime churn reaches 73%**, meaning the majority of acquired customers eventually exit the platform, significantly eroding long-term value. A large share of churn occurs within the **first 7–30 days**, pointing to onboarding and expectation mismatch rather than pricing or competition.

Product analysis shows that users often churn **before discovering meaningful value**, with average time-to-value far exceeding the time it takes customers to decide to leave. Meanwhile, revenue is increasingly concentrated among a small set of high-value Enterprise customers, creating both opportunity and risk.

Together, these signals indicate that Ravenstack’s growth is **efficient but fragile**, requiring an immediate shift in focus from acquisition to **retention, onboarding, and strategic customer prioritization**.
